            Integer value representing the X coordinate of a Rotation in EulerAngles concidering Right Wrist can rotate in the x axis from -60 to 60 degrees where -60 would rotate the hand all the way up as a stop sign and 60 would rotate it all the way down,
            Integer value representing the Y coordinate of a Rotation in EulerAngles concidering Right Wrist can not rotate in the y axis meaning it stays at 0 degrees,
            Integer value representing the Z coordinate of a Rotation in EulerAngles concidering Right Wrist can rotate in the z axis from -30 to 30 degrees where 30 would be turning the hand sideways to the thumbs side
