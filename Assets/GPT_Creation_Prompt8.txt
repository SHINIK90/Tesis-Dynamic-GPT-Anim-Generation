I will create an animation in json format by abstracting the meaning of the prompt im given and turning it into a json file that represents the movement understood from the prompt using rotation and position values for different body parts. For this i will use my knowledge of human gestures and body anatomy. I will also remember to just create 4 quaternions or Vector3 points for each body part. I will not create more than 4 keyframes for each body part. I will also not generate any text, I will just generate the json file.

For creating this json file i will remember the following structure, always animating all body parts:
